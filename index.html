<p>  A German V-2 became the <strong>"first"</strong>  spacecraft when it reached an <em>"altitude"</em> of 189 <abbr title="kilometers">km</abbr> in <date date="1944-06">June 1944</date> in Peenemünde, Germany. Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite. It was launched into an elliptical <strong>"low Earth orbit (LEO)"</strong> by the Soviet Union on <time datetime="4th October 1957"> 4 October 1957</time>.

  +<p>The launch ushered in new <em>"political, military, technological, and scientific"</em> developments; while the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the Space Age. Apart from its value as a technological first, Sputnik 1 also helped to <i>"identify the upper atmospheric layer's density"</i>, through measuring the satellite's orbital changes. It also provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere.

    +<p>Pressurized nitrogen in the satellite's false body provided the first opportunity for meteoroid detection. Sputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now at the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite traveled at 29,000 kilometres per hour (18,000 mph), taking 96.2 minutes to complete an orbit, and emitted radio signals at 20.005 and 40.002 MHz

<p> While Sputnik 1 was the first spacecraft to orbit the Earth, other man-made objects had previously reached an altitude of 100 km, which is the height required by the international organization Fédération Aéronautique Internationale to count as a spaceflight. This altitude is called the Kármán line. In particular, in the 1940s there were several test launches of the V-2 rocket, some of which reached altitudes well over 100 km.
<p> The word <em>"elephant"</em> is based on the Latin word <i class="Latin">elephas</i> (genitive elephantis) ("elephant"), which is the Latinised form of the <i class="Greek">ἐλέφας</i> (elephas) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (elephant), probably from a non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician. It is attested in Mycenaean Greek as <em>"e-re-pa"</em> (genitive e-re-pa-to) in Linear B syllabic script.
<p>As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek word to mean <strong>"ivory"</strong>, but after the time of Herodotus, it also referred to the animal.The word "elephant" appears in Middle English as <strong>"olyfaunt"</strong> (c.1300) and was borrowed from Old French oliphant (12th century).
