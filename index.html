  <p>Hello! My name is <i>Oni Oluwatosin</i>. I am a <strong>Bio-Marketer</strong>, this means I am a <strong>biochemist turned Marketer</strong>. Interesting right?
    I do a lot of digital marketing stuff like <em>website design</em> and development,Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Social Media marketing, Email marketing,
    google paid adverts and copywriting. However, I have a magic wand for Inbound Content Marketing and Strategy.
    I help small businesses, big brands and individuals to define who their target audiences are, create buyer personas, determine customers stage in the funnel.
    I also carry out keyword research,identify keywords that should be leveraged, prepare the content strategy and a content calendar, create the graphics,
    write the content, optimize for <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization"> SEO </abbr> and push live.
    <strong>Boom!</strong>
    Customers literally start fighting to spend their money on my Clients ideas, products or services.
    Carrying out Google Ads is usually just an icing on the cake.</p>
