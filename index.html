  <p>Hello! My name is <i>Oni Oluwatosin</i>. I am a <strong>Bio-Marketer</strong>, this means I am a biochemist turned Marketer. Interesting right?
    I do a lot of digital marketing stuff like <em>website design</em> and development, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Social Media marketing
    Email marketing, google paid adverts and copywriting. However, I have a magic wand for Inbound Content Marketing and Strategy. I help small
    businesses, big brands and individuals to define who their target audiences are, create a buyer persona, determine their stage in
    the funnel, carry out keyword research, identify keywords that should be leveraged, prepare a content strategy, a content calendar,
    create the graphics, write the content, optimize for <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization"> SEO </abbr> and push live. Boom! Clients literally start fighting to spend their money
    on my clients idea, products or services. Carrying out Google Ads is usually just an icing on the cake</p>

  <p> Enough about my <em>skills</em>, do I even have the <em>academic and professional credentials</em> needed to get the job done? Well, I do.
